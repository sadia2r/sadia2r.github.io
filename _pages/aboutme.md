## Personal Projects

### 📚 AI-Powered Reading & Media Tracker  
A React/Next.js app to log books and shows, fetching cover data from APIs (Goodreads, OMDb).  
I built this because I read widely and wanted a tool that combines **organisation with data visualisation**.  

**Tech:** React, Next.js, Goodreads API, OMDb API

This project grew out of my own study journey — I’ve used AI as a study partner since ChatGPT first launched.
